The long term goal is to use Robot Framework, Selenium and Jenkins to batch a continuous job search to generate a report with new job postings from my favorite sites.  The first will be recruiter sites, then individual company listings.

Phase 0

This phase just opens a list of web sites and runs searches.  It would just leave the web pages open so they can be quickly browsed.

Open a browser
Navigate to a web site
Navigate to the search Page
Enter a search term
Enter a search center and Radius if applicable

Phase 1
Compile the listings on each of the searches into a single report that can be browsed.
